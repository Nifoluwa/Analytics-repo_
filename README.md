Hello all. This repo is a look into my foray into the analytics, data and ML space. The projects here are projects curated from accross the web, or some just personal.
From using Pandas for EDA, to using Scikit-learn to build and develop models, to using Dash and Streamlit to build interactive data apps, this repo is designed using a project 
based approach and for beginner-intermediate pythonista's, data scientists, or ML engineers. Contributions, comments, fixes and patches are welcome.
I'm available for any cool projects as skill and time permit. This repo SHALL frequently be updated. Happy learning.
